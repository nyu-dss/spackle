description: This flyer calls for a Black Solidarity Day Convention to happen at the
  Manhattan Center, located at 311 W. 34th Street, on the anniversay of Black Solidarity
  day. To participate in the convention, individuals are instructed to stay home during
  the day, "Do not go to work. Do not use the telephone. Do not Shop. Do not use the
  trains or buses until sundown. Most of all, participate in the events scheduled
  for this day in your community." In the evening, participants are invited to come
  to the Manhattan Center to participate in the convention. One should note the use
  of a union bug in the lower right side of the document. Union bugs are small labels
  that denote that the individuals who produced a product are represented by a labor
  union. The presence of this emblem on the flyer is demonstrative of the solidarity
  efforts, and the stressing of economic and labor power of Black people, on Black
  Solidarity Day.
